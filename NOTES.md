# Crash course on MaterializeCSS

* Got to floating buttons aprox +12:30
* Got to Effects, aprox +22:30
* Worked with Images now onto nav, aprox +26:00
* Finished Navbars, aprox +33:40
* Worked through Collections and lists also breadcrumbs, aprox +40:00
* Got to PreLoaders worked with forms, aprox +48:00

# NOTES

* Sidebar Nav opens on the left by default. You can open on the right with some changes.
* Set up some fun collections and list. Also figured out how to make siblings in an element with emment.

Up next is the cards which should be interesting. This is a good crash course but none of the structure is right lol

* Cards are pretty useful now in everying but I like the chips you can use and have the fab button in it.
* The forms are way easier to work with and look really nice too. Excited to start designs with this.
